        <h2>Description : </h2>
        <p>
            Overall, pan-frying is considered healthier than deep-frying due to the smaller amounts of oil it uses. 
            Additionally, it's best to choose an oil that's stable at high heat and will add healthier fats to your fish. 
            Olive oil is one healthy option.
